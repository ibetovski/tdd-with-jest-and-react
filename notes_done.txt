installed:
- webpack + babel-loader
- io to run jest
- edited jest.js to use nodemon --harmony

- added preprocessor to run jsx files for jest.

todo:
- flux
- test stores
  x* include a store
  x* include an action
  x* trigger event
  x* check the data

functional tests plan:
- include component
- call component's event with simulate.__EVENT_NAME__
- check the component's state.

- unmount the component
- check the listener (is it possible at all?)
